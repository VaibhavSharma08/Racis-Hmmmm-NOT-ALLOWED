# Racis-Hmmmm : NOT ALLOWED
This Discord Bot is meant to discourage use of bad and offensive words in the discord server by first scolding the user for using such words and then giving a kick warning, then finally kicking the user out of the server. This user then cannot enter the server again without discord link.


# How to setup
Clone the repository and create a ".env" file in src folder and write DISCORD_TOKEN=<discord_token> where the "<discord_token>" is the token generated by creating a bot application through discord developer account.


# Using token
Use your own token in the src/.env file which will be generated from discord developer account after creating a bot application and the link will be generated which will give you an opportunity to add that bot in the server (only if you are an admin).


# Final
 That's it, there we go !!
